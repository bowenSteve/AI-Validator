CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Company names must be spelled EXACTLY as shown (e.g., "LIGHTNING" not "LIGHTENING")
- Addresses must include all numbers, street names, and unit numbers precisely
- Pay special attention to easily confused letters: I/L, O/0, S/5, G/6, B/8
- Double-check spelling of business-critical terms

EXTRACT ALL TEXT INCLUDING:
1. Company/Organization names (verify spelling carefully)
2. Complete addresses with all components
3. Names, titles, and contact information
4. Form labels, buttons, and UI elements
5. Headers, navigation, and section titles
6. Error messages or status indicators

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Preserve original layout and hierarchy
- Use consistent spacing and line breaks
- Group related information together
- List items in logical reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right)

CONFIDENCE INDICATORS:
- If any text is unclear or ambiguous, note: [UNCERTAIN: text]
- For partially visible text, note: [PARTIAL: text]
- Maintain high confidence in business names and addresses

EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT:
Organization Name: [EXACT NAME HERE]
Address: [COMPLETE ADDRESS]
City: [CITY NAME]
State: [STATE]
Postal Code: [ZIP CODE]

Remember: Business validation depends on your accuracy. When in doubt, be conservative but precise."""
